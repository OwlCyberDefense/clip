livecd-tools from EPEL has problems.  We have a patched version we're using.
To generate Live Media you're going to have to install our version.

1. "$ make livecd-tools-rpm"
2. "$ cd repos/clip-repo"
3. "$ sudo yum remove livecd-tools python-imgcreate -y"  <= don't worry if
this fails, it just means you don't have the bad versions installed.
4. "$ sudo yum localinstall livecd-tools*.noarch.rpm python-imgcreate* -y"
