This Makefile has a special target to make patching easier.

Typical RPM workflow for patching an existing package goes like this:
1. Get the src RPM.
2. rpmbuild -bp <srcrpm>
That unpacks the sources and applies all existing patches.
3. Go find the BUILD/ where the patched sources reside.
4. mv <srcdir> a
5. cp -r a b
6. Make changes
7. diff -purN a b > diff
8. Add diff to the spec so it is applied.

This Makefile has a target that automates steps 1-5.  Run:
1. $ rpm2cpio <srcrpm>|cpio -idmv
2. Update Makefile based on this src RPM setting PKGNAME VERSION and RELEASE
3. $ make patchy
4. Make modifications in b/
5. Create your diff
6. Add it to the spec file.
