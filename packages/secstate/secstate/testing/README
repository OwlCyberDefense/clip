To run all of the tests, go to the secstate/testing directory and call
tests.py with no arguments. This calls every test listed in active-tests.list:
./tests.py

To run a list of tests from the command line, provide a white space separated 
list to the script in the secstate/testing directory:
./tests.py <test1> <test2> ...

To run tests with prompts to automatically update golden results, add the --fix flag:
./tests.py --fix <test1> ...
