            <description>
            Many computer compromises occurs as a result of account name and password guessing.  This
            is generally done with an automated script that uses repeated logon attempts until the correct
            account and password are guessed.  Logon and logout logs, account locking, retry delays, and
            session disconnect for users, as well as root, are effective methods of detecting and controlling
            potentially malicious account access.  The SA will properly configure these methods to control
            unauthorized account access.  Most systems do support account lockout, while some systems
            will disconnect the session after three consecutive failed logon attempts.  Accounts will be
            locked after three failed logon attempts.  Due to different system support, which is beyond the
            configuration control, and cannot be modified, most UNIX systems do support account lock out
            due to failed logon attemps, but certain releases of Solaris do not.  In this event, session
            disconnect will be configured.

            <title>3.1.4 Inactivity Timeout/Locking</title>
            <description>
            When a user is logged on to a UNIX system, the system is susceptible to alteration or damage. A
            user may become busy or distracted and inadvertently leave a logon session. Such idle sessions
            leave the UNIX system vulnerable to unauthorized user exploitation. When a workstation is left
            unattended, users will ensure sessions are locked and not accessible without I&amp;A or users will
            log out. Additionally, users will ensure they log out when finished with a session.
            Sessions/terminals will be logged out or locked after 15 minutes of inactivity. Screen lock
            programs can be configured to activate if terminals are idle for a specified period. Shells (e.g.,
            sh, ksh, etc.) also contain variables that can be set to terminate logon sessions after a specified
            period of inactivity. If a screen lock device is available, it should be able to be invoked by the
            user when the user wishes to leave the terminal unattended. Most terminals provide screen
            lockout, as opposed to session termination. There are also additional options that may be
            employed to ensure an unattended session is not left open or unlocked, such as token cards.
            Token cards are removed from a client when leaving a console and the token card is then used
            for access to the console upon return. Some terminals require continuous displays, such as
            network management terminals, and may be exempt from the requirement as long as they are
            located in a restricted access area, the logon session is not a root session, and fully justified and
            documented with the IAO.

                The SA will configure systems to log out
                interactive processes (i.e., terminal sessions, ssh sessions, etc.,) after 15 minutes of inactivity
                or ensure a password protected screen lock mechanism is used and is set to lock the screen
                after 15 minutes of inactivity.
