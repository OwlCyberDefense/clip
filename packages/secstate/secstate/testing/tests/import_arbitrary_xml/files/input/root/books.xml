              Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
              Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
              Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
              With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
              Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
              Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
              Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
              That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
              In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
              Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
              Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
              Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
              Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
              That with no middle flight intends to soar
              Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
              Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
              And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
              Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
              Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
              Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
              Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
              And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
              Illumine, what is low raise and support;
              That to the highth of this great Argument
              I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
              And justifie the wayes of God to men.

            <text>
                   To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
                him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
                and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
                any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that
                one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but
                admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
                reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a
                lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never
                spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They
                were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the
                veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
                to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
                adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
                might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
                sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power
                lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
                nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and
                that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable
                memory.
