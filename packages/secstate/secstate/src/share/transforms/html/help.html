                        <dt>Pass:</dt>
                        <dd>The target system or system component satisfied all the conditions of the Rule; a pass result contributes to the weighted score and maximum possible score.</dd>
                        <dt>Fail:</dt>
                        <dd>The target system or system component did not satisfy all the conditions of the Rule; a fail result contributes to the maximum possible score.</dd>
                        <dt>Error:</dt>
                        <dd>The checking engine encountered a system error and could not complete the test, therefore the status of the target's compliance with the Rule is not certain.  This could happen, for example, if a Benchmark testing tool were runwith insufficient privileges.</dd>
                        <dt>Unknown:</dt>
                        <dd>THe testing tool encountered some problem and the result is unknown.  For example, a result of 'unknown' might be given if the Benchmark testing tool were unable to interpret the output of the checking engine.</dd>
                        <dt>Not Applicable</dt>
                        <dd>The Rule was not applicable to the target of the test.  For example, the Rule might have been specific to a different version of the target OS, or it might hvae been a test against a platform feature that was not installed. Results with this status do not contribute to the Benchmark score.</dd>
                        <dt>Not Checked</dt>
                        <dd>The Rule was not evaluated by the checking engine.  This status is designed for Rules witha role of 'unchecked', and for Rules that have no check properties.  It may also correspond to a status returned by a checking engine.  Results with this status do not contribute to the Benchmark score.</dd>
                        <dt>Not Selected</dt>
                        <dd>The Rule was not selected in the Benchmark.  Results with this status do not contribute to the Benchmark score.</dd>
                        <dt>Informational/Mitigated</dt>
                        <dd>The Rule was checked, but the output from the checking engine is simply information for the auditor or administrator; it is not a compliance category.  This status is the default for Rules with a role of 'unscored'.  This status value is designed for Rules whose main purpose is to extract information from the target rather than test compliance. Results with this status do not contribute to the Benchmark score.</dd>
                        <dt>Fixed</dt>
                        <dd>The Rule had failed, but was then fixed (possibly by SecState or by the human auditor).  Results with this status should be scored the same as <b>Pass</b>.</dd>

                        <dd>When evaluating a definition or test, the characteristics being evalutaed could not be found in the system characteristic file or the characteristics can be found but a collected object's flag is 'not collected'.</dd>
                        <dt>Error:</dt>
                        <dd>When evaluating a definition or test, the characteristics being evaluted exist in the system characteristic file but there was an error either collecting information or in performing analysis.  For example, if there was an error returned by an api when trying to determine if an object exists on a system.</dd>
                        <dt>Not Evaluated:</dt>
                        <dd>When evaluating a definition or test, a choice was made not to evaluate the given definition or test.  The actual result is in essence unknown since if evaluation had occurred it could have been either true or false.</dd>

                        <dd>When evaluating a definition or test, the definition or test being evaluated is not valid on the given platform.  For example, trying to collect Linux RPM information on a Windows system.</dd>
