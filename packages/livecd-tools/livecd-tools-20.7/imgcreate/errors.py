    # Some error messages may contain unicode strings (especially if your system

    # not handle this appropriately (at least until 2.5) because str(Exception)
    # returns just self.message without ensuring that all characters can be
    # represented using ASCII. So we try to return a str and fall back to repr
    # if this does not work.

    # Please use unicode for your error logging strings so that we can really
    # print nice error messages, e.g.:
    #     log.error(u"Internal error: " % e)
    # instead of
    #     log.error("Internal error: " % e)
    # With our custom __str__ and __unicode__ methods both will work but the
    # first log call print a more readable error message.
