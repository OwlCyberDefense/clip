Occasionally you might introduce a package
that must be built before another package.  
This occurs when one package references 
another package in the BuildRequires: block
in the RPM spec file.  To ensure the
dependent package is built first, edit the 
Makefile for the other package, that is
the one with the relevant BuildRequires:
block, and add the other package to 
the srpm Makefil target dependency list.

E.g. this line:
srpm: $(PKGNAME)-srpm

becomes:
srpm: $(PKGNAME)-srpm dependent-package-rpm
