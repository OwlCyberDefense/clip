Here is a quick list of the things you need to do to get started.

1. Add your user to /etc/sudoers (required since mock and livecd creator use
chroots)

2. CHANGE THE DEFAULT PASSWORD IN YOUR KICKSTART (kickstarts/clip-rhel6/clip-rhel6.ks)!
CLIP intentionally ships with an unencrypted default password!  It is "neutronbass".  
DO NOT LEAVE THIS PASSWORD LINE INTACT!

3. Go back and re-read #2.

4. Run "./bootstrap.sh". 

5. After you have run bootstrap once you do not have to run it again. 
Roll an ISO by running "$ make clip-rhel6-iso".
Note: for a complete list of targets available please run "$ make help".

After you have successfully rolled an installation ISO it is time to move on
to customizing the image.  Each topic related to customizing the image is
discussed in Help-*.txt files in the root of the CLIP repo.
