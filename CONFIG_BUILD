# List of RPMs that are pre-rolled.  These will be linked into our custom yum repo during the build process.
# Once referenced here you can start using them in the kickstart.
# NOTE: You could perform the same task by putting the packages in a directory, creating a yum repo, then adding the path
# to CONFIG_REPOS.

# The ISO_VERSION field doesn't alter functionality at all.  The variable name and value will appear in /root/clip-info.txt.
# This provides a way to figure out what version of your repo was used to generate the ISO once it is installed.  E.g. 
#   Tester: "My install is busted."
#   Developer: "What version do you have installed?"
#   Tester: "I don't know.  How do I figure that out?"
#   Developer: "Run '# cat /root/clip-info.txt' and send me the output."

# These values can be used to tweak the build to facilitate development and debugging.
# The CONFIG_BUILD_PRODUCTION flag sets all other build configuration to production values.
# CONFIG_BUILD_ENFORCING_MODE is used to put the system in permissive mode or enforcing mode after install.
# CONFIG_BUILD_SECSTATE_REMEDIATE SecState audits the systems using SCAP content then remediates problems by 
#                                 modifying the system to resolve identified problems.  CLIP uses SecState in 
#                                 %post of the kickstart.  If this is set to "n" SecState is used to audit but
#                                 not remediate.  You can still remediate at run-time after deployment.
# CONFIG_BUILD_UNCONFINED_TOOR allows the toor user to run the unconfined (read->all powerful) toor_r:toor_t role.
#                              Normally the toor user is confined in the sysadm_r:sysadm_t role.
# Note: these variables and values will be inserted into /root/clip-info.txt for inspection at run-time.
