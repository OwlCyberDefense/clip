# CLIP officially supports RHEL.  If you choose to use CentOS it will probably
# work.  There is guidance below for both.
#
# Basic instructions:
#
# This is the file where you configure yum repos.  The packages found in these
# yum repos can be referenced from the kickstart files in 
# ./kickstarts/<name>/<name>.ks.  The packages from the repos below will be 
# included in generated ISOs.
#
# Some basic repos *must* be available for CLIP itself.  They are RHEL/CentOS,
# EPEL, and RHEL/CentOS Optional repos.
#
# Note that for now, these must be local repos.  We plan on adding FTP/HTTP
# support in the future.  One of the issues we are trying to wrap our heads
# around is ensuring we still version the packages used when rolling the
# builds.  To do this with FTP/HTTP we would like to wget the packages when
# rolling the ISO.  We do not want to just stick URLs into kickstarts
# because we lose the benefit of rigorously versioning the packages used.
# Anywho, we're thinking about it, but no timeline yet ;)

# NOTE: this is the right path for Quark Security's build VM
#centos7.0 = /opt/repos/centos7.0-1406

# A RHEL/CentOS repo must be available. Must be a local path (we use NFS mounts).
rhel = /opt/rhel-7-x86_64/rhel-x86_64-server-7/Packages/

# NOTE: If using RHEL, *not CentOS*, you must provide the Optional repo. 
# An RHEL Optional repo must be available. Must be a local path (we use NFS 
# mounts).
#opt = /mnt/repos-6-3/rhel-6-3-x86_64/rhel-x86_64-server-optional-6/getPackage

# It is fairly common to pull in packages from EPEL but having EPEL is not a requirement!
#epel = /mnt/repos/epel-pinned-revisions

# NOTE: <= RHEL 5 requires BUILDGROUPS repo.  RHEL 6 has the BUILDGROUPS stuff built-in.
# A groups repo must be available. Can be a local path or an http/ftp location.
# WARNING: The CLIP team is no longer testing or supporting RHEL 5 builds from this tree.  
#          It might work, but probably will not.  
#buildgroups = /mnt/repos/buildgroups
